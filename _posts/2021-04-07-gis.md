"What I have noticed is that people come in to communities with a preconceived notion with how they are going to help the community and what they think the community needs. And they miss the mark just about every time. So when you say partnership it’s like a conversation. You have to talk and then you have listen. You have two ears and one mouth. So you’re supposed to listen more. But people that come in with their helper hat on have no idea where to begin. And so that is why the organization, an organization like ours gets looked over because we’re telling you your hat’s on backwards. . . . The key to showing that you’re not that stupid is to ask questions. And you did." Boll-Bosse and Hankins (2018)
