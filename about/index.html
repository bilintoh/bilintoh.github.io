title: About Thomas Bilintoh

		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I developed a passion for problem-solving via
engineering right from my Senior High School (SHS) education.
After SHS, I obtained a BSc in Geomatics Engineering from the
University of Mines and Technology (UMaT), Tarkwa-Ghana.
During my undergraduate studies at UMaT, I developed a deep
a√πection for the world of GIS and Remote Sensing. I have earned a
Master's degree in Geography from Michigan State University and
currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Geography at Clark University. So far,
this has been my journey, but who am I at the moment? Thomas
Mumuni Bilintoh is a Ph.D. student at the Geography Department
at Clark University. Bilintoh creates quantitative methods that
contribute to Geographic Information Science (GIS) and Remote
Sensing. He is currently developing methods to quantify the
dynamics of land categories.</p>
